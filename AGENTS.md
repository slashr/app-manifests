# AXP - Autonomous Execution Protocol

When AXP is mentioned in the task, either by the user or in TASKS.md, you should work end‑to‑end without needing user input. At a high level the flow should be: pick task → plan → implement → PR → green checks → codex reviewer approval → merge → verify release → next task.

---

## Minimal Rules

1. **Don’t stop early.** Keep going until a **Stop Condition** (below) is met.
2. **Merge gate:** Only merge when **all required checks are green** **and** Codex has given a **👍** (review approval, approving comment, or 👍 on PR description).
3. **Act, don’t wait.** Use local CLIs (`git`, `gh`, `kubectl`, `aws`, `terraform`, `ansible-playbook`) and **poll** proactively; no user nudges.

---

## The Loop (simple checklist)

1. **Pick task:** Either perform the task user has requested, or pick one from TASKS.md. If picked from TASKS.md, mark it as IN PROGRESS
2. **Plan & branch:** Write a brief `PLAN.md`.
3. **Implement:** Commit small, logical changes.
4. **Open PR:**
   ```bash
   gh pr create --fill \
     --title "TASK-###: <short title> [AXP]" \
     --label axp
   ```
5. **Watch checks (poll ~60s):**

   ```bash
   gh pr checks --watch
   ```

   * If a check fails, **fix → push → watch again**.
   If you pushed fixes after PR creation and after Codex reviewer had already given a thumbs up, then request a re-review from codex reviewer by commenting "@codex review again"
   
6. **Codex review:**
   Codex starts a review automatically on PR creation. You will see that it adds eyes emoji to the PR description when it is revewing. 
   The eyes emoji changes to a thumbs up emoji if review passes. If you see this then you are safe to merge. 

   Otherwise, codex reviewer leaves a review comment as a reply to one of it's main comments. 

   You should address this review and leave a reply to that comment inline (not as a independent comment) mentioning whether you accept the review and fixed it or whether you think the review doesn't need to be fixed and skipped it. 

   If you pushed a fix for the review, then add "@codex review again" at the end of the reply to make codex reviewer review the fresh commits again. 
   
7. **Merge:**
   If PR checks are green and codex has given a approval and all review comments (if any) are addressed, it can be merged
   ```bash
   gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch
   ```
8. **Post‑merge release:**
   After merging the PR, watch the Actions pipeline until it passes
   ```bash
   gh run watch --workflow "Release"
   ```

   * If it **fails**, open a minimal **Recovery PR** and repeat the loop. Try up to **3** times. If still failing, **escalate** (see Stop Conditions).
9. **Close the loop:** Mark the task `DONE` in `TASKS.md` and **pick the next AXP task**.

---

## Stop Conditions

* **No AXP TODO** tasks remain.
* **Blocking error:** cannot auth, missing permissions/secrets, CI/infra down > 60m, or recovery attempts exhausted (3 PRs).
* User explicitly says **stop AXP**.

If blocking: open an issue `AXP: Escalation — TASK-###` with a short summary and links, then stop.

---

## Optional Niceties

* Maintain a single‑line audit in `.axp/TRACE.md` (time, action, PR/run URL).
* Copy the task’s **Acceptance** checklist into the PR body and tick as you verify.

---

### Mapping to your basic flow

1. grab a task → 2) analyze/plan → 3) `gh pr create` → 4) watch checks → 5) watch Codex → 6) merge → 7) next task.
