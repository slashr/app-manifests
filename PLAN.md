# PLAN — TASK-001

1. Capture a concise description of the homelab deployment repo and its main apps.
2. Draft a root `README.md` explaining the directory structure plus links to FAW docs (`AGENTS.md`, `TASKS.md`).
3. Proofread for clarity and ensure the acceptance checklist in `TASKS.md` will be satisfied.
